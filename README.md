A mash-up of Pokemon and Blackjack. Just open up an IDE suitted for Android development and import the project's parent directory. Run the project in the emulator and play away!
I don't plan on making any money off this, so feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own needs. The code is a little old and could definitely use some refactoring. I'm sure there are plenty of bugs I have yet to see either.
